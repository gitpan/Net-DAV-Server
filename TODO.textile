h2. Functionality to be implemented by Net::DAV::Server

h3. RFC 4918 Class 2 locking compliance

* Enforce locking at the userland level, independent of any expensive, operating system-specific mechanisms like @flock()@
** When evaluating an operation on a resource, determine the lock status based on absolute resource location and type
* Identify a suitable, compact database storage mechanism to store the following information on any given lock:
** Opaque lock token/UUID
** Resolved local filesystem path (preferably as provided by @realpath()@)
** Requestor (author)
** Lock depth for collections (n, infinite)
** Lock expiration

h4. The @If:@ header

* Ensure any locking-related operations are conditionally acted upon as long as the @If:@ header lists the opaque lock token for a given resource, as well as the root of any given inifinitely-locked directory, where applicable.

h4. Supported clients

# libneon
#* cadaver
#* gnome-vfs
#* KDE WebDAV kioslave
# Microsoft Web Folders
#* Microsoft Office
#* Microsoft Front Page
# Adobe Dreamweaver
# Bit Kinex

h3. Other goals

* Apache mod_perl integration
* Attribute storage support (plugin)
* Lock support (plugin)
* Authentication support (plugin)
* Avoid buffering entire files in memory
* Full litmus test complience
* Quota/"disk free" support (both Mac 512byte and standards-compliant)
* Revisit owner/creater validation, this had to be opened up for cpdavd.
